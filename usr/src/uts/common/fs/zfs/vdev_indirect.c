/*
 * An indirect vdev corresponds to a vdev that has been removed. Since
 * we cannot rewrite block pointers of snapshots, etc., we keep a
 * mapping from old location on the removed device to the new location
 * on another device in the pool and use this mapping whenever we
 * would use the DVA. Unfortunately, this mapping did not respect
 * logical block boundaries when it was first created, and so a
 * DVA on this indirect vdev may be "split" into multiple sections
 * that each map to a different location. As a consequence, not all DVAs
 * can be translated to an equivalent new DVA.  Instead we must provide
 * a "vdev_remap" operation that executes a callback on each contiguous
 * segment of the new location. This function is used in multiple ways:
 *  - reads and repair writes to this device use the callback to create
 *    a child io for each mapped segment.
 *  - frees and claims to this device use the callback to free or
 *    claim each mapped segment.
